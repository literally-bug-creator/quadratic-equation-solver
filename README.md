# Quadratic Equation Solver

This project provides a simple implementation of a quadratic equation solver for equations of the form `ax2+bx+c=0`.

# Description

The program takes coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, calculates the discriminant, and finds the roots of the equation if they exist.

# Implementation Notes

It's important to note that object-oriented principles and classes have been intentionally omitted from this implementation. This design choice was made as part of a learning exercise to explore and understand basic software architecture without relying on advanced programming paradigms.

The goal was to demonstrate how logic can be structured using only functions and procedural programming, emphasizing simplicity and clarity â€” especially useful at the early stages of learning software design principles.
